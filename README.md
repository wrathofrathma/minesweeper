# Minesweeper with Vue.js 3.0 + Typescript + Tailwind CSS

I saw someone post on reddit their minesweeper clone, but whenenever they clicked on a tile, there was a delay/input lag before it would reveal a mine or exposed empty tiles. I'm mostly just building this to see if I can build it faster.

The only resource I used outside of tailwindcss & vue was a bomb icon I found on OpenGameArt.org (default favicon.ico kinda dry)
